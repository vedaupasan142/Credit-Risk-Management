# Credit-Risk-Management

Problem Statment:

Default risk or credit risk is reaching its heights due to many limitations in the process of disbursement
of loans. There is no proper mechanism to forecast the risk. As the process is executed with human
interventions which is having the threat of emotions, biasing etc. which is the root cause for the
interrupted revenue generation and increases the collection cost. To address these issues machine
learning models are used to predict the default probability and can be able to solve NPA issues.

The scope of this project is limited to classifying and testing the defaulting conditions leading the credit
risk. The scope of the study is to classify defaulters and non-defaulters in an efficient manner.

Dataset: Open-source – Credit Risk Assessment
( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset )

The data presented here was collected from a bank for analyzing Credit Risk Assessment. It consists
of 11 features and total of 32581 instances were collected and are currently stored in a CSV file.
Each instance holds the information of person’s age, income, home ownership, loan amount, loan
interest rate, loan status.

Conclusion:

Timely assessment of credit risk helps in decreasing non-performing assets which is the biggest
challenges to the banking Industry in the world leading to Financial crisis. The Present study is
focused on assessment of credit risk using machine learning models – Random Forest and support
vector machine models. Various performance evaluation metric techniques such as accuracy,
precision, F1-Score, Recall are used for comparing the ML models. From these results the
prediction accuracy of Classification is 86.8 percent and 80.99 percent for Random Forest
classifier and Support vector machine model respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that Random
Forest model gave higher accuracy when compared to Support vector machine model for the
considered dataset and thus helped in ensuring the optimizing of Credit risk assessment.
